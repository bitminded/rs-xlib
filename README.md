# rs-xlib
This project aims to provide bindings for the xlib library, a library that is built ontop of the X Window System protocol. Be aware that it is severely lacking in functionality as it is part of an ongoing personal learning experience and therefore only contains the definitions that are required for the time being. Out of these reasons pull requests won't be accepted. The use of this repository is discouraged.
